# Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) Projects

This repository contains the projects I have coded as part of the software subteam at UAS at UCLA, an undergraduate drone team dedicated to designing, manufacturing, and programming drone technologies. The aforementioned project consists of a camera calibration and object segmentation program that uses OpenCV.
