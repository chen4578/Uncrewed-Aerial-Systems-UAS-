# Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) Projects

This repository contains a project I have coded as part of the software subteam at UAS at UCLA, an undergraduate drone team dedicated to designing, manufacturing, and programming drone technologies. The aforementioned project consists of a camera calibration program that uses OpenCV.

For more information, please see the [UAS website](https://www.uasatucla.com/).
